Ti=PURPOSE OF THE STUDY

1.Sec=Women recovering from breast cancer treatment can have very different and more or less severe symptoms day to day.  These symptoms affect quality of life and make managing recovery difficult.  We would like to understand the causes of these symptom variations.

2.Sec=New technologies allow people to record and track their health and symptoms in real time.

3.Sec=This study will monitor individualâ€™s health and symptoms using questionnaires and sensors via a mobile phone application.  The data from many participants will be analyzed to better understand the differences in symptoms reported. We will also assess whether mobile devices and sensors can help better measure and manage these symptoms.  You will have a unique account that you can use to review your own data and see how it fluctuates over time.  Ultimately our goal is to learn with you how to improve quality of life after breast cancer treatment.

4.Sec=Your data, without your name, will be added to the data of other study participants and analyzed by the study team.  Also, if you choose to, your study data (without your contact information) can be made available to other qualified researchers for this and future research.  You will have a unique account that you can use to review your own data. 

5.Ti=How long will I be in the research study?

5.sec=We anticipate this study will last about six months, however the app can remain on your phone for multiple years, and you can keep using it to track your symptoms and review your data.

6.Ti=How many people will take part in this study?

6.sec=We anticipate enrolling 20,000 subjects in the study.
