Ti=USE OF DATA FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

1.sec=This study gives you the option to share your coded study data more broadly, with other researchers worldwide for use in this research and beyond to benefit future research. 

2.sec=If you choose to share your data broadly, your coded data (without your contact information) will be added to a shared study dataset on {StoragePlatform.Name.Short}. This shared study dataset will be made available to qualified researchers who are registered users of {StoragePlatform.Name.Short} and who have agreed to using the data in an ethical manner, to do no harm and not attempt to re-identify or re-contact you unless you have chosen to allow them to do so.  No name or contact information will be included in this shared study dataset. Researchers will have access to the shared study data but will be unable to easily map any particular data to the identities of the participants.  The Principal Investigator and Sponsor will have no oversight on the future use of the shared study data by other researchers.
