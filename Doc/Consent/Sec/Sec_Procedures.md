2.Ti=What we will and will not do with the data?

2.1.Ti=Data processing

2.1.sec=We will electronically process your data and separate your account information (name, email, contact information, etc.) from your study data (your responses to surveys and the measurements from the phone itself when you perform activities). We will combine your coded study data (without your name) with those of other study participants.  The combined data will be transferred electronically to {StoragePlatform.Name.Full}, {Sponsor.Name.Full}â€™ computerized research platform for storage and analysis.

2.2.Ti=Use in research

2.2.sec=The research team will analyze the combined data and report findings back to the community through Blog or scientific publications.  Your coded study data (without your contact information) may also be used by other researchers and for research purposes beyond this study if you choose to share them more broadly.  The Principal Investigator and Sponsor will have no oversight on the future use of the combined study data.
